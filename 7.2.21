These words are threatening to subsume me. There is editing and parsing, splicing and kaleidoscopic reviewing to be done,
but I can't bring myself to do it, at least I haven't been able to, yet. To write without self-agonizingly thinking
about others-future self first and foremost-a real luxury. To live and breathe in that mind-set is life-harmonizing,
for me at least. I consider this my personal Tao. I want to be a writer. Perhaps I already am a Writer.
The definition, and certainly connotation, seems nebulous to me. I want to fill notebooks with words, and
publish a select few for the world to enjoy. I don't want to work a traditional job. Until I Make It,
I need to be willing to do some labor (intellectual, preferably) outside of my Flow, but the penultimate goal
is to live for and by language. A breath-sustaining dream. After experimenting with a tangentally psychedelic substance
(the most I've taken is 900 mg) , dextromethorphan, and straightening out afterwards, this is the course I have set for myself.
In many respects, It is similar to my dream of being a professional programmer, though with less obvious (and dare I dream,
less in general) pitfalls and stress-crevasses. What is the plural of crevasse? I don't know. Anyways.

This morning I drove my grandmother's Subaru Outback (2010 winter edition--with manual paddle shifters on the sides of the
steering wheel !!) to Verdi and back. Feeling and non-anthropomorphically identifying with the machine; semi-consciously shifting
through hills, turns, and round-a-bouts. Located a possibly ideal area to play spikeball with friends (what friends ?), although It
is near a marshy delta area, so bugs may perhaps be a problem--not an insurmountable obstacle. My mind still thinks algorithmically
which is cool especially for logic and problem solving. Interesting to see how that plays out w/r/t class differentials in
my upcoming intro to symbolic logic course in the fall.


pfffff---Picayuné is progressing steadily. The 2nd person-perspective Over-arcing and 3rd person-limited Inset nested-narrative
have been typed up and pushed to my github /stories depository. Both need editing and then the real motherfucker--splicing them
together. As a hypothetical concept it sounds neat and challenging but ... when I begin to think about it in anything approaching
systematic form my mind screams well first it tries to distract itself but when I really knuckle down past any discreet, bounded
i.e example my mind screams for pharmacological assistance. Which is a pretenscious, amaturely literary way to admit that I'm
weak and still overcoming my cannabis compulsion. That little part of you that exclaims or notices 'neat' when you type a nifty
sentence i.e an alliteration that wasn't consciously planned--needs to be calibrated. too much and you become bombastic, egomaniacal (
-maniacal at least for me, maybe some people simply become egotistical--how blasé) , too little and you have no self esteem and
have no self-referential way to judge the quality of your work.

Considering taking 3 mg of dextromethorphan -- about $60 worth -- to try and reach other dimensions. so far, on nearly 1 mg, I have
(merely) felt the universe expanding/accelerating and--. perhaps stepping up dosages is the wiser course of action. Although I am
tempted to
throw caution to the gulf stream, I am aware of potential serotin syndrome- type side effects, so further perusing of the scientific
literature
and mother's-anxiety charnel house of web-md type websites. the good news w/r/t overdoing It is that I have a prescription (filled and nearly
unused) for Zyprexa, an antipsychotic.

need to call back [name] for pro-forma interview at Guess factory outlet's (sparks mall) part-time retail position. think it's a good
fit for me.
This is about all I have in me, right now. Might rest a bit before driving up to chickadee point and tripping my balls off. Can't think
of much else to do, to be brutally honest. Oh yea, Picayuné. swung by the buddhist center in midtown yesterday, took a yoga/meditation
 class while coming onto a 400mg (at this point, light) dose of dextromethorphan. except for this one position that required me to fold
 my unyielding ankles beneath my ass and sit on them, it was enjoyable. did wonders to loosen me up and relieve somatically-stored
 stress. So yea. going to do some stretching, then some core exercises before showering (and somewhere in there before showering, take a
 nice, relaxed defecation), packing a backpack and driving to either overlook or swim in lake tahoe. Might even drive all the way around it,
 or until the dmx impairs my reflexes and judgement (hah!) too far.
